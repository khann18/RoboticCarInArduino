# RoboticCarArduino
Hello!
These codes are used for an Arduino-based Elegoo Smart Robotic Car. This repository includes many seperate codes that accomplish various tasks. 

All of the codes initialize variables that connect voltages to specific pins. These will be labeled at the top of the code. Unless 
you are using the Elegoo Smart Robotic Car V1.0 (that is what we used), it is very likely that you will need to either change these
variables to fit your needs or change around the wiring to fit the pins that connect to the pins intialized in these variables.

As a heads up, most codes will require an ultrasonic sensor. We worked with a HC-sr04 sensor, however, other sensors may also be compatible.There are some codes that utilize different instruments as well, such as line tracking modules.

Thank you and we hope this code may be useful for you.
